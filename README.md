# Overview

This project is a generic Middle client provider that executes configured queries
against a database on a periodic schedule, and publishes the results as JSON
to a Middle server.

#HOW TO USE

- navigate to the app directory or repository (clone repo if not available locally)
`
  cd /path/to/repo
`
-  Create a config file (.sqldb-provider.yaml) in the repo root. eg:

`
database-connection-string: root@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/world # Connection string to access the database
database-type: mysql # database type. Useful in selecting appropriate sql driver
client-token: "eyJhbGciO..." # client-token generated by middle server
nats-url: nats://localhost:4225 #path to nats cluster
nats-cluster: middlefront # nats cluster name

`
- Make sure middle server is running. (Look to relevant documentation on how to run the middle server locally)
- Build the provider.
`
  go build
`
- run relevant command. (see below for command)
